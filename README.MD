# NOTE
This project was built in Processing. So if you whish to run it and or make changes you'll have to install this godforsaken thing:(
(I don't like this thing if you hand't noticed)
We also used the Sound 1.3.2Sound library made by The Processing Foundation, You'll probly need it or uncomment the soundEngine related code
